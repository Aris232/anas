<h2>Artificial intelligence</h2>

<p><b>Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. Many authors define it as: "the study and design of intelligent agents", and an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that increase its chances of success in achieving its mission or the mission of its team. This definition, in terms of goals, actions, perception, and environment, is due to Russell & Norvig (2003) and other definitions also include knowledge and learning as additional criteria. The term was originally coined by computer scientist John McCarthy in 1956, and he himself defined it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines". Andreas Kaplan and Michael Heinlein define artificial intelligence as "the ability of a system to correctly interpret external data, learn from that data, and use that knowledge to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation</b></p>
<p><b>The field was founded on the assumption that intelligence can be described so precisely that it can be simulated by a machine. This raises philosophical debates about the nature of the human mind and the limits of scientific methods, issues that have been the subject of mythological, fictional, and philosophical debates and tales since ancient times. There is also debate about what intelligence is, what types of intelligence humans possess, and how to simulate it by machines. Artificial intelligence has been and continues to be the subject of highly optimistic ideas, and has suffered major setbacks throughout history. Today, it has become an essential part of the technology industry, carrying the burden of the most difficult problems in modern computer science. Artificial intelligence research is highly specialized and technical, to the point that some critics criticize the "disintegration" of the field. Subfields of artificial intelligence revolve around specific problems, the application of special tools, and old theoretical differences of opinion. The main problems of artificial intelligence include abilities such as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception, and the ability to move and change objects. General intelligence (or "strong artificial intelligence") remains a long-term goal of some research in this field.</b></p>

<h2>History of Artificial Intelligence Research</h2>

<p><b>In the mid-20th century, a handful of scientists began exploring a new approach to building intelligent machines, building on recent discoveries in neuroscience, a new mathematical theory of information, the development of cybernetics, and, above all, the invention of the digital computer, a machine that could simulate the human computational thinking process.<br>

    The modern field of artificial intelligence research was founded at a conference on the Dartmouth College campus in the summer of 1956. These attendees became leaders in artificial intelligence research for several decades, especially John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon, who founded artificial intelligence laboratories at MIT, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and Stanford. They and their students wrote programs that surprised most people. The computer solved algebraic problems, proved logical theorems, and spoke English. By the mid-1960s, this research was being generously funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. These researchers made the following predictions:<br>
    
    In 1965, H. A. Simon: “Machines will be able within twenty years to do any work that a human being can do.”<br>
    
    In 1967, Marvin Minsky: “Within a generation… the problem of making ‘artificial intelligence’ will be largely solved.”<br>
    
    But they failed to realize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced. In 1974, in response to criticism from Sir James Lytle and continued pressure from Congress to fund more productive projects, the US and British governments cut off funding for all undirected exploratory research into AI, the first major setback for AI research.<br>
    
    In the early 1980s, AI research experienced a revival with the commercial success of “expert systems,” AI programs that simulate the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts. By 1985, AI research had reached a market value of more than $1 billion, and governments were once again funding it. A few years later, starting with the Lisp Machine crash in 1987, AI research experienced another, more prolonged setback.<br>
    
    In the 1990s and early 21st century, AI made further inroads, albeit somewhat behind the scenes. AI is used in logistics, data mining, medical diagnosis, and many other areas throughout the technology industry. This success is due to several factors: the greater power of today’s computers (see Moore’s Law), an increased focus on solving specific subproblems, the creation of new relationships between AI and other fields working on similar problems, and, above all, researchers beginning to adhere to strong mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards.<br>
    
    In the 21st century, AI research has become highly specialized and technical, and has divided into subfields so deeply that they are no longer mutually exclusive. Divisions of the field have grown around specific institutions, researchers have worked on specific problems, long-standing disagreements about how AI should work, and the application of different tools at scale.</b></p>


<h2>Types of artificial intelligence</h2>

<p><b>Artificial intelligence can be divided into:<br>

    <h3>Narrow AI</h3>
    This is AI that specializes in one field, for example, there are AI systems that can beat the world champion in chess, and that is the only thing they do.<br>
    
    This type refers to computers with human intelligence in all fields, meaning that they can perform any intellectual task that a human can do. Creating this type of intelligence is much more difficult than the previous type, and we have not reached this level yet.<br>
    
    <h3>Super AI</h3>
    Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines super intelligence as “a thought that is much smarter than the best human minds in almost every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.” Because of this type, the field of artificial intelligence is an interesting field to delve into.</b></p>

<h2>Artificial Intelligence Problems</h2>
<p><b>The problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been divided into a number of specific sub-problems. These consist of specific features or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to embody. The features listed below have received the most attention.</b></p><br>

<h3>Deduction, logical thinking, and problem solving ability</h3>
<p><b>Early AI researchers developed algorithms that mimicked the sequential, logical reasoning humans use to solve puzzles, play board games, or make logical deductions.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In the 1980s and 1990s, AI research led to highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, using concepts from probability and economics.
     <br>
     <br>
     For hard problems, most of these algorithms require enormous computational resources—leading to a “combinatorial explosion”: the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem exceeds a certain size. Finding algorithms that are more capable of solving problems is a top priority for AI research.
<br>
<br>
Humans solve most of their problems using quick, intuitive, rather than conscious, reasoning, a process that early AI researchers were able to mimic automatically. AI research has made some progress in mimicking this “sub-symbolic” type of problem-solving skills: approaches include emphasizing the importance of sensorimotor skills for higher-order thinking; and research into neural networks attempts to mimic the structures in the human and animal brains that give rise to this skill.
